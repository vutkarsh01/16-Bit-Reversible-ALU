# 16-Bit-Reversible-ALU
## Introduction
This Repository contains Verilog codes for Reversible ALU and Non Reversible ALU and the comparision report for both.
Reversible ALU is made of reversible gates, example: Fredkin gate, Feyman gate to name a few.
## Idea
Reversible logic gate is an n-input , n-output logic device with one to one mapping.
In 1961, Rolf Landauer proposed that - "Whenever we use a logically irreversible gate we dissipate energy into the environment." The loss of information is associated with laws of physics requiring that one bit of information lost dissipates kTln2 of energy.
Landauer/Bennett: all operations required in computation could be performed in a reversible manner, thus dissipating no heat!
And so according to a second law of thermodynamics: ds = dq/T(for reversible process).Thus, a reversible ALU should be more power efficient.\\

## Result 
From the Genus and Innovus reports fetched, the reversible ALU was more area and power efficient than the non reversible ALU.\\
